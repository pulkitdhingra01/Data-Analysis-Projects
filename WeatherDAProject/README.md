As we all know weather forecast is something that helps us to predict the nature of the environment 
in the up coming days so using this projcet we can analyse the wearther data of a specific area and 
at aspecific time to predict the nature of the weather in that particular area. Using this code you 
can obtain all the necessary factors of a weather to determine the weather conditions of that place 
at the particular time.
